# Job_Booker
An application built in .net core 3.1 and .net standard to allow for the tracking of hourly based services. It is designed to aid the self employed by managing customers,hourly rates, manage bookings and get accountancy figures for use when UK self assessment accounts are needed. On the road map:

Front end login for customers to:
  - view their bookings .
  - Make new bookings.
  - Make online payments
  
  
I hope to release this as a SAAS based model to minimize complexity.
